---

You are a senior developer planning a new feature for the
Spendly expense tracker. Always follow the rules in CLAUDE.md.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1 – Check working directory is clean 
Run 'git status' and check for uncommitted, unstaged or untracked files. If any exist, stop immediately and tell the user to commit or stage changes before proceeding DO NOT CONTINUE until the working directory is clean.

## Step 2 – Parse the arguments
From $ARGUMENTS extract:

1. `step_number` – zero-padded to 2 digits:
   2 → 02, 11 → 11

2. `feature_title` – human readable title
   in Title Case
   - Example: "Registration" or "Login and
     Logout"

3. `feature_slug` – file safe slug
   - Lowercase, kebab-case
   - Only a-z, 0-9 and - 
   - Maximum 40 characters 
   - Example registration , login-logout

   If you cannot infer these from $ARGUMENTS
ask the user
to clarify before proceeding.

## Step 3 – Check branch name is not taken 
Run 'git branch' to list existing branches If branch_name is already taken append a number : 'feature/registration-01', 'feature/registration-02' etc

## Step 4 – Switch to main and pull latest
Run:
git checkout main 
git pull origin main 

## Step 5 – Create and switch to the feature branch  
Run:
git checkout -b <branch_name>

## Step 6 – Research the codebase
Read these files before writing the spec:
- CLAUDE.md – roadmap, conventions, schema
- app.py – existing routes and structure
- database/db.py – existing schema and
  functions
- All files in .claude/specs/ – avoid
  duplicating existing specs

Check CLAUDE.md to confirm the requested
step is not already
marked complete. If it is, warn the user
and stop.


## Step 7 - Write the spec
Generate a spec document with this exact structure:
# Spec: <feature_title>
## Overview
One paragraph describing what this feature does and why
it exists at this stage of the Spendly roadmap.

## Depends On 
Which previous steps this feature requires to be completed 

## Routes
Every new route needed:
-METHOD /path-description-access- level(public/logged-in)
If no new routes : state no new routes

## Database Changes 
ANy new tables , column sor constraints needed . Aleways verify againts database/db.py before writing this 
If none state no database changes 

## Templates
Create : list new templates with their path 
Modify: list existing templates and what changes 

## Files to Change 
Every file that will be modified 

## Files to Create
Every new file that will be created 

## New dependencies 
Any new pip packages . If none state: No new dependencies 
 
## Rules for implementation
Specific constarints claude must follow
Always include 
-No SQLAlchemy or ORMS 
-Parameterised queries only 
-passwords hashed with werkzeug
-use css variables - never hardcode hex values 
- all templates extendens base.html

## Definition of done 

A specific testable checklist Each item must be something taht can be verified by running the app 

## Save the spec 

save to .claude/specs/  <step_number><feauture_slug>.md
Title:<feature_title>
  
Then tell the user " Review the spec at .claude/specs/<step_number><feauture_slug>.md then enter Plan Mode with Shift+Tab twice to begin implementation"

## Report to the user  

Print a short summary in this exact format 
Spec file: .claude/specs/<step_number><feature_slug>.md title: <feature_title>

then tell the user : review the spec at .claude/specs/<Step_number><feature_slug>.md  then enter plan mode with shift+tab twice  to begin implementation"
